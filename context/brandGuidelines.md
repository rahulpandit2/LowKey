# 3. Logo & usage

## Primary mark

“LowKey” wordmark.

Use:

* On homepage hero
* On header navigation
* On official communication

## Secondary line

“The Good Internet Project”
Used only in hero or About page. Not required in small placements.

## Clearspace

Maintain clear spacing around logo. Do not crowd with navigation or elements.

## Do not:

* Add glow or shadow
* Change proportions
* Add gradients
* Place on busy backgrounds without contrast

---

# 4. Imagery & visual language

Your current design language (from screenshot) is:

* Dark background
* High contrast serif hero
* Minimal UI
* Editorial composition
* Strong negative space

This should continue across all brand surfaces.

## Imagery rules

Use:

* High contrast photography
* Minimal, thoughtful imagery
* Abstract editorial textures (grain, subtle noise)
* Clean framing

Avoid:

* Bright neon social-media-style graphics
* Meme-style content visuals
* Overly playful illustrations

LowKey should feel like:

* A journal
* A manifesto
* A thoughtful publication

Not like:

* A viral app
* A gaming platform
* A trend-driven brand

---

# 5. Iconography

Icons must:

* Be minimal
* Thin stroke
* Neutral in tone
* No playful emoji-style icons in core UI

Reaction icons should remain text-driven (e.g., “Interesting”, “Relatable struggle”) instead of only visual emojis.

Icons support clarity. They do not dominate attention.

---

# 6. Motion & interaction philosophy

Motion must be:

* Subtle
* Short
* Purpose-driven

Use motion to:

* Indicate state change
* Confirm action
* Guide attention

Avoid:

* Bounce effects
* Loud entrance animations
* Long loading animations

LowKey should feel stable, not energetic.

---

# 7. UI behaviour guidelines

## Buttons

* Clear
* Intentional
* Not oversized
* Minimal hover effect

Primary actions should feel decisive, not flashy.

## Forms

* Clear labels
* Direct validation
* No playful copy inside forms

## Modals

* Calm background overlay
* Clear confirmation steps
* Explicit consequences for destructive actions

Example:

> “This action will permanently delete your account after 30 days.”

---

# 8. Voice, microcopy & templates

## Composer placeholder

“Share a thought, a problem, or a win.”

## Incognito Help message

“This post will appear without your identity. You control who sees your profile.”

## Report confirmation

“Thank you. We will review this.”

## Deletion confirmation

“Your account is now hidden. It will be permanently deleted in 30 days unless restored.”

Microcopy must always:

* Be short
* Avoid exclamation marks
* Avoid emotional manipulation

---

# 9. Badges & verification marks

Badges must look:

* Clean
* Minimal
* Subtle

Never flashy or gamified.

## Public badges

Examples:

* Helpful Mind
* Deep Thinker
* Community Pillar

## Verification badges

* Verified Profile
* Certified Therapist

Verification must include a small tooltip explanation:

> “Identity verified. This is not an endorsement.”

Badges should signal trust — not status competition.

---

## Founders words
`I realize perfection is an illusion, but it can become more real than it was yesterday.`

## Founders philosophy
I used to dread the word "perfect." Not because I was humble, but because it felt like a dead end—and I was nowhere near finished.

There were nights when the silence was deafening. I was full of self-doubt, facing conflicts I didn't know how to resolve, and honestly, making some of the worst decisions of my life. When I finally reached out for help, the internet didn't offer me a place to talk; it offered me rehab. It felt like the world had decided that if a man is struggling, he must be an addict, not just a human being in need of a sounding board.

Every social platform seemed designed to extract performance: post something, get likes, feel validated (or not), repeat. The cycle was exhausting. The feedback was hollow.

I started asking: What if engagement wasn't about numbers? What if feedback was structured to be constructive, not critical? What if we could share vulnerably without fear of public judgment?

I built LowKey because I needed a place that didn't exist: a space for emotional support that isn't a clinical diagnosis. No leaderboards to "win" at life, no vanity metrics to chase. Just quiet, honest engagement for people who want to think better, together.

LowKey is the answer for the days when you don't have the answers, but you're brave enough to ask the questions. It is a place where thoughtful adults can think out loud, get real feedback, and grow.

This is the Good Internet.
