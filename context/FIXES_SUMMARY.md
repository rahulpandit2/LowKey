Unable to post the feedback on the posts.
It shows Invalid feedback type error message
There is no way to report a user or post or community
The share option still does not work
I still need to move to a different section before the results appear under all. but if there any results for the search query, it should show them under all at any given time.
There are still no default notification or messages
I see the message 'You don't have permission to manage this community.' even though I created it.
When I bookmark a post I get Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
No actual bookmarks are present in the bookmarks page.
We have not added any options to enhance the functionality of the pages like setting or profile for users.
paginate the pages in server admin to reduce load on server
Even if I promote a user to admin, I don't see the admin options in the user's profile. No notification are sent to the user.
Nothing is found under communities page in server admin.
I don't even want to check more pages. It's like you have not done anything but made minor ui changes.

Make sure to work on all features. Use commannds like CURL and more to verify what is hapening, make test cases to test each feature Instead of assuming things. Make sure 1. we are performing the actions correctly i.e. to the server, and the db, and 2. make sure we show the output in the ui correctly. What is suppose to be hiddend must remain hidden and do not clutter everythigng with console.lgos
